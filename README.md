I have committed the changes in the order of test cases for a particular step and then the code changes. The test cases initially given are manually given in a file. The rspec test cases are in a separate file.

Step 1: Initial calculator which accepts a valid string of integers
step 2: The string will be long
Step 3: The string will contain one or multiple continuous new line characters
Step 4: The string will contain any other delimiter other than comma
Step 5: If negative numbers are present, exception will be thrown with the list of negative numbers
